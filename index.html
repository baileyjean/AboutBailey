  <h1>There's Something About Bailey</h1>
  <h2>Hello World! My name is Bailey, and this is a landing page with info about me.</h2>

    <h3><b>About Me</b></h3>
    <p>      
      I grew up on a carnival in Arizona; in fact, I was born into a multi-generational, entrepreneurial-carny family. In other words: I am <i>Carny Royalty</i>. <br /> I'm a big nerd, and love math & science. I often question what I want to be when I grow up, but hopefully it involves software engineering!

      I LOVE animals... but <u>especially</u> dogs! Although I have many photos of myself with various animals, Courage the Cowardly Doge was a special rescue boi, and we just really love this picture. Enjoy!
